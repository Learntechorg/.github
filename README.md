## üß≠ Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, it's essential for our team to stay updated with modern frameworks and tools. This program is geared toward helping all team members gain a solid understanding of:

- **Frontend Frameworks**: Angular
- **Backend Development**: Python and best practices
- **Database Management**: MySQL

Through a structured curriculum, hands-on projects, and collaborative learning, we aim to build foundational skills in these areas.

## üéØ Objectives

Our primary objectives for this program are to:

- Understand core principles and best practices of **Angular** for building dynamic frontends.
- Gain proficiency in **Python** programming for backend development.
- Master database operations and management using **MySQL**.
- Implement practical projects to solidify our knowledge and showcase our skills.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

To organize our learning, we‚Äôll focus on one skill at a time, with a mix of lectures, workshops, and projects.

### Phase 1: Angular (Frontend Development)
- **Topics**: Components, Services, Routing, Forms, HTTP Client, Directives, Angular CLI.
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Project**: Build a dynamic single-page application (SPA) to showcase skills learned.

### Phase 2: Python (Backend Development)
- **Topics**: Basics of Python, Flask/Django framework, RESTful API design, Data Validation, Error Handling, Authentication & Authorization.
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Project**: Develop a backend API service that connects with a frontend (Angular) and a database (MySQL).

### Phase 3: MySQL (Database Management)
- **Topics**: Database Schema Design, CRUD Operations, Joins, Stored Procedures, Indexing, Optimization.
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Project**: Design and implement a database schema that connects with the Python backend.

### Final Project: Full-Stack Application
- **Goal**: Combine Angular, Python, and MySQL skills to build a full-stack web application.
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks
- **Description**: Each team member will contribute to frontend, backend, and database integration, practicing full-stack development and collaborative coding.
